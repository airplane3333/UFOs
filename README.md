# The Truth Is Out There

##Overview of the analysis:
---
The purpose of the website is to filter UFO (unidentified flying objects) that 
were sighted in January 2010.  The data can be filtered based on multiple criteria.

## Results:
---
There were many UFO sightings in January 2010 from all over the world.  Many of the
sightings only lasted a few minutes and most sightings involve seeing lights in the sky.
Using the filters on the left side of the page, a user can use multiple filter to find 
data specific to their city, state, and coutnry.

## Summary:
---
The website uses javaScript to take the user inputs from the HTML and the filter the 
data displayed on the site.  The data is also in javaScript using key value pairs which 
allows the users to filter on any of the key within the data.

An improvement that could be made is maybe adding a totla or even a graph to to show number 
of sightings when the data is filtered.  Also the data is only a month, having more data 
would be and being able to filter by month to see if sightings are higher during different 
times of the year.
